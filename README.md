# Bare International Style Advisor Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Business Intelligence (BI)** and **Data Analysis** case study based on customer evaluation data for Style Advisors at Bare International. The analysis aims to assess advisor performance across various operational zones, identify key performance drivers, and deliver actionable insights and recommendations to improve customer experience (CX) and sales potential.

## Project Objectives

The primary goals of this analysis were:

1.  **Performance Grading:** Grade Style Advisors (High, Average, Low, Bottom Performers) based on their overall evaluation scores.
2.  **Zonal Comparison:** Compare average evaluation scores and performance distribution across East, West, North, and South zones.
3.  **Criteria Analysis:** Examine performance across key criteria such as **Store Ambiance**, **First Impressions**, **Discovery**, and **Trial Experience**.
4.  **Actionable Insights:** Use data visualization to highlight trends and provide specific, data-driven recommendations for management.

## Key Insights & Results

The analysis revealed several critical findings:

* **Top Performer Zone:** The **North Zone** demonstrated the strongest customer interactions and service delivery, leading with the highest average evaluation scores.
* **Areas for Development:** The **South Zone** and **West Zone** were identified as needing focused behavioral and product-knowledge training, especially in the **Discovery** and **Trial Experience** phases of the customer journey.
* **Operational Consistency:** High scores and consistency in **Store Ambiance** and **First Impressions** across all zones reflect effective store-operations management.
* **Improvement Trend:** Time-trend charts revealed a steady improvement toward the mid-month of October, indicating the effectiveness of field interventions or scheduled store-visit cycles.

## Technologies Used

* **Microsoft Excel:** Data cleaning, transformation, and initial calculations.
* **Data Visualization:** For creating charts and dashboards.
* **Reporting:** PDF for final report compilation.
